This is a basic bingo calling web app, written in Rails 3.

The aim is for it to run on the iPad, anywhere else is a bonus, for now.

Test site on Heroku is here http://bingo-caller.heroku.com/games

Bugs

- error when not in a session, check it better
- flash notice/error not appearing correctly

To Do


- in general, user can see if session is public or their own
- can edit/nextball only if its theirs
- only allow creater of game to advance to next ball
- honour public/private game flag, only show your games and public games

- want different layout/font size for ipad vs web - how to do that?

- players tracked by session, perhaps track by caller.

- players ability to delete/edit cards_played, which players in a game



- ensure auto/page reload only happens after number is called/audio

- validate max number on game
- better message when all numbers called


- put last number in a ball



- allow to create/upload new sound files from website... how to check the sounds are good/valid...

- support for oauth/openid

- mp3s dont seem to be working in firefox... (firefox/mp3 compat issue)

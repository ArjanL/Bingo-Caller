This is a basic bingo calling web app, written in Rails 3.

The aim is for it to run on the iPad, anywhere else is a bonus, for now.

Test site on Heroku is here http://bingo-caller.heroku.com/games


To Do

- show games for session

- only allow creater of game to advance to next ball

- keep a track of players/winners (first line/full house), perhaps have concept of session/evening, so if a little money
is involved, can keep track of things... also number of cards played per game

- button to start same kind of game again (eg after house/bingo called)

- ensure auto/page reload only happens after number is called/audio

- validate max number on game
- better message when all numbers called


- honour public/private game flag, only show your games and public games

- better ui - bigger current number, especially on iPad

- put last number in a ball



- allow to create/upload new sound files from website... how to check the sounds are good/valid...

- support for oauth/openid

- mp3s dont seem to be working in firefox... (firefox/mp3 compat issue)

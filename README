This is a basic bingo calling web app, written in Rails 3.

The aim is for it to run on the iPad, anywhere else is a bonus, for now.

Test site on Heroku is here http://bingo-caller.heroku.com/games


To Do

- audio files for 13-90

- js to auto advance, pause option

- better ui - bigger current number, especially on iPad

- support for multiple callers, choosing which to use and random from all

- validate max number on game
- better message when all numbers called

- put last number in a ball

- add users and link games to users, public/private options
- only allow creating user to advance balls in a game

- keep a track of players/winners (first line/full house), perhaps have concept of session/evening, so if a little money
is involved, can keep track of things... also number of cards played per game


- allow to create/upload new sound files from website... how to check the sounds are good/valid...
